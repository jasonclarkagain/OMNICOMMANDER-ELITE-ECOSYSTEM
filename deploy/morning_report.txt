Answer: I don't know if you are still having this problem but i was able to solve it by deleting the virtualenv in the .buildozer folder and then running buildozer -v android debug again. This will recreate the virtual environment with the new python version.

You can delete the folder using:

\begin{code}
rm -rf ~/.buildozer/android/platform/python-for-android/dist/default/build/venv
\end{code}

Comment: I already solved it by uninstalling and reinstalling buildozer, but thanks for the help anyways!

I installed java version 17 through sdkman and tried setting JAVA_HOME in .bashrc and in the current shell before running Buildozer but it still shows the same error. Please help me fix this issue, thanks!

Answer: You need to install openjdk-16.
Run the following command to install it using APT:

\begin{code}
sudo apt install openjdk-16-jdk -y
\end{code}

I've already reinstalled java using SDKMAN! but no luck. I don't know what to do anymore.

Answer: For some reason the error was fixed after restarting my PC and reinstalling buildozer with python3

I would really appreciate any help on resolving this issue as I am completely stuck here.

Answer: I had the same problem while building apk.
Try changing your python version to 3.9 and install buildozer using pip.
It worked for me.

I'm new to Android development and I am trying to create a Python program that uses kivy and builds an APK using Buildozer. However, when I run the command "python buildozer.py", it stops at this point. The error message seems to be related to Java, but I don't know how to fix it. Can anyone help me?

You can try to use pip install command instead of buildozer android debug deploy run. This should work if there is no issue with your code or environment. You can also try to uninstall and reinstall the buildozer package, it may fix some unknown issues. If you're still facing problems please provide more details about the error.

I have tried reinstalling buildozer but still no luck. Can someone help me figure out what I'm doing wrong?

Also I am using the latest version of buildozer and android sdk ndk, and python 3.9.16.

Answer: Firstly, you have to install Java JDK from Oracle website, then set the environment variables JAVA_HOME and PATH. Then you can use java commands. I tried this on Windows.

I've tried several things already like installing all necessary packages for kivy but I still get the same error...
Any help would be much appreciated!

Answer: I had to update my buildozer by running: pip3 install --upgrade buildozer and it worked.

I'm using the latest version of kivy and python.

Answer: The error is telling you that it can't find java. You need to install Java (openjdk) on your system. You can use sudo apt-get install default-jre to do this in Ubuntu.

Comment: That worked! I had a version of openjdk installed but it was too old, so I uninstalled it and installed the latest version with sudo add-apt-repository ppa:openjdk-r/ppa followed by sudo apt-get install openjdk-17-jdk. After that I was able to run buildozer android debug. Thank you!

The error says that java is not installed but I have installed java successfully and added the path in bashrc file. Please help me to resolve this issue. Thanks.


Answer: Try running:

\begin{code}
$ sudo apt-get install openjdk-17-jre
\end{code}

Then run buildozer again. If that doesn't work, try setting the JAVA_HOME environment variable in your .bashrc file to where the Java binary is located.

I'm running:
Python 3.10.4,
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS,
kivy==2.0.0rc4
buildozer==1.3.0

What could be the issue? I've been stuck here for days and it's not making sense to me. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Answer: I solved this problem by downgrading kivy version to 2.0.0rc2. It seems that there is some problem with rc4 version, as the same code works on my windows machine with rc4 but not on ubuntu.
